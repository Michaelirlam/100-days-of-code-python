# 100 Days of Code - Day 20 and 21

## Snake Game

Day 20 and 21 projects were part 1 and part 2 of building a classic snake game using the Turtle module.

I have built the snake game with 2 modes:

  easy: No walls, snake moves to the opposite side of the screen when passing through a wall
  normal: Walls, game is over if the snake hits a wall

The speed of the snake increases for every 5 points the player scores (every 5 food the player's snake eats)
and will continue to grow in size on eating food indefinitely until the game is over (snake hits is own tail
in easy mode, or snake hits its own tail or a wall on normal)

The game was a lot of fun to build and helped cement my knowledge of classes and inheritence. I'm  quite fond
of the game snake and would like to do more with it in the future however I have hit the limitations of using
the Turtle module so any future development will be done via moving the game to using either Tkinter or Pygame
