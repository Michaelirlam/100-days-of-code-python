# 100 Days of Code - Day 18

This project uses the Python module Turtle Graphics https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.goto
to perform various exercises such as creating a square, dashed line, spirograph etc with the final project recreating
a famous Hirst painting.

This project didnt really test me like some of the previous ones as it was more cementing learning I'd done in previous
projects however it did stress the importance of reading documentation and getting familiar with what you can and cant do
with modules
